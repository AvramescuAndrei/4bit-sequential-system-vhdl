# 4-bit Sequential System (VHDL)

## Description
Design and implementation of a 4-bit sequential digital system on FPGA using VHDL.
The system supports up/down counting and Gray code operation, with an asynchronous active-high reset.

## Key Features
- 4-bit sequential system
- Up / Down counting mode
- Binary and Gray code operation
- Asynchronous reset
- 1-second clock period
- Hardware validation on Basys3 FPGA board

## Technologies
- VHDL
- Xilinx Vivado
- FPGA: Artix-7 (Basys3)

## Implementation
The project includes the complete VHDL description, FPGA constraints,
synthesis and implementation flow, and hardware validation on a physical FPGA board.
